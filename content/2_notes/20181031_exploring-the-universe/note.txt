Title: DIFFƏRƏNT

Text: 

Now greetings to the world
Voice of the one called Big Gong-Zilla alongside Burna Boy, ya know
Yes rude boy!
Ya dun know we different
Different style we delivering
I don't have no equivalent
Different predicament
Every day a different problem
Different lie from the government
Different politics, people with different qualities
Different tings dem happening
Different feeling, looking for a different healing
Read it with a different meaning
Different book
Come with the different look
Same spliff, different toke
Different election, sell a different false hope
Then them hang us with a different rope
It's a different time, different tings pon mi mind
Different steps we a climb
While dem connive
Different egos collide
Back full of different knives
Different mi know
Although we different still we similar
Every man bleed blood, that's a big similarity
Seven billion show one cinema
One world we live inna
And through social media become the new encyclopedia
Exposing reality inna real time
Click a button, and watch a video
Then you just might find
Every man love dem family
That is another familiarity
To demonstrate the similarity
That doesn't mean there's not a big difference up in a quality
Of copy from the real original
Cuh ya dun know we different
Different acts of belligerence
Me differently intelligent
Different medicine, mi nah talk chemical medicine
Different leaves and remedies
Different studying of my roots and origin
Tell my truth in melodies
History teachers ah tell student different lies, now
Different from what me find out
Mi know seh knowledge is the key, and ah that dem ah hide out
Fuck up the youth dem mind
Bringing different force
So different gun we ah buss
You know it ain't hard to find us
